# ðŸ”¥ Bobby's Algebraic Graph Toolkit ðŸ”¥

### What is Algebraic Graph

Check out the whitepaper on [algebraic graphs](https://github.com/snowleopard/alga-paper/releases/download/final/algebraic-graphs.pdf) and this awesome [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdQGLewU-8k) by it's author Andrey Mokhov.

### Setup

#### Use a pre-built binary

You can find binaries for OSX, Linux & Windows in the [releases page](https://github.com/bobymicroby/boby-alga-toolkit/releases)

> If you are on linux and receive `error while loading shared libraries: libtinfo.so.5`
> please install  the `libncurses5` pkg  . The binary is supposed to be statically built
> but one PopOS user reported that it's not working without installing ncurses.


#### Build from source

Start the tool either using `stack run`. If you don't have [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/) you can install it with `curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh`





### How to create a graph

With the tool open enter the following commands 

```
follow elon bitcoin
follow elon bobby
follow bitcoin greta
follow greta bobby
```
