  Implementations of binomially random graphs, as described by Erdős and Rényi.
  Graphs generated using this method have a constant edge probability between two nodes.

    Generate a unlabelled directed random graph using the Algorithm introduced by
    Erdős and Rényi, also called a binomial random graph generator.
    Note that self-loops with also be generated with probability p.
    This algorithm runs in O(n²) and is best suited for non-sparse networks.
    The generated nodes are identified by [0..n-1].
    Example usage, using a truly random generator:
    
    > import System.Random.MWC
    > gen <- withSystemRandom . asGenIO $ return
    > erdosRenyiGraph 10 0.1
    ...

{-|
    Like 'erdosRenyiGraph', but uses a newly initialized random number generator.
    See 'System.Random.MWC.withSystemRandom' for details on how the generator is
    initialized.
    By using this function, you don't have to initialize the generator by yourself,
    however generator initialization is slow, so reusing the generator is recommended.
    Usage example:
    > erdosRenyiGraph' 10 0.1
